Magic the Gathering is a pretty old card game consisting of gazillions of cards, which can get out of hand pretty easily at one's home, especially if he or she decides to share cards with a flatmate (which was my case).<br><br>
The idea here is to create an online database of one's cards with additional informations about cards, as well as to provide possibility of deck building/saving and browsing global card database.
<br>
This work is currently under construction. I plan to succesively add aditional features.
<br>
<br>
Feel free to check the project's current state, comment and test. Thank you!
